# Project: Processes and Signals in Linux

## Overview

This project covers the fundamentals of process management and signal handling in Linux through a series of Bash scripts. The scripts demonstrate how to interact with processes, retrieve PIDs, list running processes, and handle signals. Process and signal management is essential for controlling programs and understanding system behavior in a Unix-like environment.

The project is designed for both beginners and advanced users to explore process IDs (PIDs), signals, and process-related commands in Bash scripting.

- **`0-what-is-my-pid`**: Script to print the current process ID (PID).
- **`1-list_your_processes`**: Script to list running processes for the current user.
- **`2-show_your_bash_pid`**: Script to filter out PIDs associated with Bash processes.
- **`3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`**: Simplified output for Bash PIDs.
- **`4-to_infinity_and_beyond`**: A script that prints indefinitely, demonstrating process handling.

Usage
Script Descriptions
0-what-is-my-pid:

Prints the PID of the running script.
Usage:
bash
Copy code
./0-what-is-my-pid
Output:
php
Copy code
<PID of the current shell>
1-list_your_processes:

Lists all processes running under the current user.
Usage:
bash

./1-list_your_processes
Output: Displays a process list in this format:
sql
Copy code
USER       PID  %CPU  %MEM     VSZ    RSS   TTY      STAT  START   TIME  COMMAND
2-show_your_bash_pid:

Displays lines with the word "bash" to identify Bash processes.
Usage:
bash
Copy code
./2-show_your_bash_pid
3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy:

Outputs the PID of Bash processes in a simplified format.
Usage:
bash

Process Management
Processes are instances of programs running in a system. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID), which can be used to monitor, manage, and kill the process. Common commands used in the scripts:

ps: Displays information about running processes.
kill: Sends signals to processes (e.g., to terminate them).
top or htop: Interactive tools to monitor processes.
Signal Handling
Signals are used in Unix-based systems to send notifications to processes. They can be used to interrupt, terminate, or pause processes. The following are common signals used in this project:

SIGINT (2): Interrupts a process (usually via CTRL+C).
SIGTERM (15): Gracefully terminates a process.
SIGKILL (9): Forcefully terminates a process without cleanup.
Common Linux Commands Used
ps: Shows currently running processes.
kill: Sends a signal to a process, usually to stop it.
pidof: Retrieves the PID of a named process.
pgrep: Searches for processes based on name and other attributes.
