## Script Categories
Each category contains scripts that perform related functions. Here’s a brief description of each:

- **Initialization Files, Variables, and Expansions**: Scripts that demonstrate how to manage shell startup files, environment variables, and command expansions.

- **File Management**: This section includes scripts for basic file operations, such as copying and moving files.

- **User Interactivity**: Scripts designed to interact with users, prompting for input and providing personalized feedback.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Scripts that perform basic arithmetic calculations and conversions between number systems.

## Recent Updates
- **[Date]**: Created initial project structure and added basic example scripts.
- **[Date]**: Enhanced file management scripts to include error handling.
- **[Date]**: Developed user interactivity scripts to improve user engagement.
- **[Date]**: Added arithmetic operation scripts for educational purposes.

## Personal Work
This project serves as both a learning tool and a reference guide for shell scripting. Key objectives include:

- **Hands-on Learning**: Users can interact with scripts to understand how shell commands work.
- **Real-World Applications**: The scripts demonstrate practical uses of shell scripting in system administration and automation.
- **Building Foundations**: The project aims to provide foundational knowledge for further exploration of Linux and shell scripting.

## To Get Started
To set up the repository and begin experimenting with the scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/alu-shell.git
   cd alu-shell
Navigate to the desired directory:

bash
Copy code
cd init_files_variables_and_expansions
Run the scripts: You can execute any script to see its functionality:

bash
Copy code
./init_file_example.sh
Set up your environment: If your scripts rely on specific environment variables, export them as needed:

bash
Copy code
export VARIABLE_NAME=value
