# Bash Scripting Projects

## Recent Updates
- **10-fizzbuzz**: Implemented a Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 100 with FizzBuzz logic.
- **11-read_and_cut**: Created a Bash script to display usernames, user IDs, and home directories from `/etc/passwd` using a while loop.
- **12-tell_the_story_of_passwd**: Developed a Bash script that tells a story based on user details from `/etc/passwd`.

## Personal Work
- Focused on automating repetitive tasks using Bash scripting to improve efficiency in workflows.
- Engaged in learning advanced Bash scripting techniques, including loops and file manipulation.
- Collaborated with peers to troubleshoot and optimize scripts for better performance.
